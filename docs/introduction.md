# Introduction to flyfield

Welcome to the **flyfield** documentation!
flyfield is a Python toolset that automates the creation, filling, and data extraction of interactive PDF forms built around **white box placeholders**.

## What is flyfield?

flyfield offers both a **Python library** and a **command-line interface (CLI)** designed to automate workflows involving:

- Detecting and extracting white rectangular placeholders in vector PDFs
- Generating interactive form fields aligned to those placeholders
